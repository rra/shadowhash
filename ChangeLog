	* ShadowHash.pm: Add SEE ALSO and COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE sections
	to the documentation.  Reformat for current formatting style.

1999-06-02  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* README: Tie::ShadowHash 0.6 released.

	* ShadowHash.pm: Added documentation of tagged data sources and of
	the "text" tagged data source in particular, as well as some
	examples, now that this has been verified as already working.

	* test.pl: Added tests for special text data sources that take a
	filename and a sub that returns a list of key and one or more
	values.

	* test/pairs.txt: New file.
	* test/triples.txt: New file.

	* README: Tie::ShadowHash 0.5 released.

	* ShadowHash.pm: Fixed NEXTKEY again; it was skipping over too
	much of the source when it hit a deleted key.

	* test.pl: Added a test to ensure that deleted keys don't show up
	in the keys of the shadow hash.

	* ShadowHash.pm: Added some comments to the tied hash section of
	the code, fixed a bug in NEXTKEY where it didn't skip past entries
	that had been deleted.

	* test.pl: Switched from using SDBM_File to using AnyDBM_File
	since for some reason SDBM isn't built on the Mac port.  Also
	switched to building the DBM on the fly before running any tests,
	since a lot of DBMs, including SDBM, are byte-order-dependent.

	* test/first.txt: New file.
	* test/first.dir: Removed.
	* test/first.pag: Removed.

1999-03-22  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* README: Tie::ShadowHash 0.3 released.

	* TODO: New file.

	* ShadowHash.pm: [Revision 0.3] Added documentation.

	* test/first.dir: New file.
	* test/first.pag: New file.
	* test/full: New file.
	* test/second.txt: New file.

	* test.pl: New file.

	* Makefile.PL: New file.

	* ShadowHash.pm: [Revision 0.2] Don't use exists when finding a
	key in the databases, since some tied databases can't handle it
	such as ODBM, NDBM, and SDBM without my patch.  This means that
	keys with undefined values don't correctly override later
	identical keys with defined values.  *sigh*  Also, make add()
	return true.
