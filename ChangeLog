        * README: Tie::ShadowHash 0.4 released.

        * test.pl: Switched from using SDBM_File to using AnyDBM_File
        since for some reason SDBM isn't built on the Mac port.  Also
        switched to building the DBM on the fly before running any tests,
        since a lot of DBMs (including SDBM) are byte-order-dependent.

        * test/first.txt: New file.
        test/first.dir: Removed.
        test/first.pag: Removed.

        * README: Tie::ShadowHash 0.3 released.

        * TODO: New file.

        * ShadowHash.pm: [Revision 0.3] Added documentation.

        * test/first.dir: New file.
        test/first.pag: New file.
        test/full: New file.
        test/second.txt: New file.

        * test.pl: New file.

        * Makefile.PL: New file.

        * ShadowHash.pm: [Revision 0.2] Don't use exists when finding a
        key in the databases, since some tied databases can't handle it
        (ODBM, NDBM, SDBM without my patch).  This means that keys with
        undefined values don't correctly override later identical keys
        with defined values.  *sigh* Also, make add() return true.
